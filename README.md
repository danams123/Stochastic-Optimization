# Stochastic-Optimization
This project is to compare and optimize waiting time in queues in supermarket between normal queues and faster queues we implemented.

**Flow Of Code**
1. Generating random customers and reciepts data.
2. Running two algorithms on the data:
  1. First algorithm: basic algorithm represents normal supermarket.
  2. Our algorithm: aims to decrease the waiting time and to increase cashiers productivity.
3. Results: total time of handling customers in normal supermarket, and total time of handling customers in our supermarket.

   example of result:
