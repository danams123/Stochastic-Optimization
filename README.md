# Stochastic-Optimization
This project is to compare and optimize waiting time in queues in supermarket between normal queues and faster queues we implemented.

**Flow Of Code**
1. Generating random customers data.
2. Running two algorithms on the customers data:
  1. First algorithm: basic algorithm represents normal supermarket.
  2. Our algorithm: aims to decrease the waiting time and to increase cashiers productivity.
3. Results: total time of handling customers in normal supermarket, and total time of handling customers in our supermarket.   

**requirements**
- Python installed(click [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you didn't downloaded/installed python).

**Running the Project** 

 - clone the project to the folder you want
